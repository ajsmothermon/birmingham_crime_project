# Birmingham Homicide Data Project
This is a repository for the data wrangling performed on the Birmingham homicide data. Data wrangling and preparation was prepared using R and then exported as a .csv that was plugged into Tableau Desktop. 

## The reason for data cleaning:
The City of Birmingham has posted homicide data for 2010-2018, however, this data is disaggregated into separate years. In turn, some fields have been saved as different types and names depending on year. The goal of this data cleaning process was to produce a single dataset that could be used to compare homicide data over time.
